# Collective Access: A Walkthrough
[Collective Access](http://www.collectiveaccess.org) is a popular, extensible open source Collection Management System designed to support the collection management functions of galleries, libraries, archives and museums.

Although the Collective Access developers and community maintain excellent [documentation](http://docs.collectiveaccess.org/wiki/Main_Page) for the project – including a [Getting Started](http://docs.collectiveaccess.org/wiki/Getting_Started) guide – this documentation lacks exemplars that can be used to quickly initiate new users (domain non-experts, in particular) that have been charged with installing and configuring a new system (e.g. for the sake of evaluation).

As such, this [walkthrough](https://github.com/MisterTJB/Collective-Access-A-Walkthrough/blob/master/WALKTHROUGH.md) provides a small dataset and step-by-step instructions that are designed to guide an uninitiated developer or systems administrator through the installation and population of a Collective Access instance. The walkthrough provides commentary on:

* A typical use case
* The installation process
* Data mapping and data import
* Media import
* Modifying fields

This walkthrough does not cover the totality of the vernacular, structure and capabilities of Collective Access; rather, this walkthrough aims to convey the minimal amount of information necessary to familiarise oneself with the system and begin to make meaningful use of its documentation.
