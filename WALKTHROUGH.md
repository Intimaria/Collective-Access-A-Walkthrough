# Collective Access: A Walkthrough

## Document Outline[Collective Access](http://www.collectiveaccess.org) is an extensible collection management system that has been designed to capture metadata about arbitrary objects, their relationships and aggregation, and their administration.This document has been prepared to initiate software developers and systems administrators who may be unfamiliar with Collective Access, the collection management domain, or both.The [Background](#background) section offers a dissection of the Chicago Film Archive’s website – which presents data and functionality provided by Collective Access – as a means of exposing the utility of Collective Access via an exploration of a canonical use case; moreover, this section is helpful for intellectually connecting user-facing data abstractions to their back-end implementation.The [Installation](#installation) section acts as a walkthrough for installing a Collective Access instance (either on a local machine or a remote server) and populating it with data such that the usage and administration of the system is made clear.

Lastly, the [Modification](#modification) section provides examples of adding fields and bundles; redefining or renaming fields; and deleting unnecessary fields.## <a name="background"></a>BackgroundAt its core, Collective Access is an open source, platform-agnostic content management system that focuses on providing collection management functions to support the activities of organisations that act as guardians for artefacts having some long-term (usually cultural or intellectual) value.Where a content management system might be almost-solely concerned with storing and rendering multimedia, a collection management system typically augments this with additional metadata that captures the provenance, conservation, rights management, and other information pertaining to the long-term preservation of an object.Collective Access differs from most commercially-available collection management systems in that it provides an interface through which organisations are able to tailor the suite of fields, functions, and interfaces provided by the system. Although the source code for Collective Access may be forked and modified, the system has been designed in such a way as to encourage modifications to be made via the web-based administrator interface.### Example – The Chicago Film ArchiveThe extensibility of Collective Access makes it somewhat-difficult to inscribe the core functionality of the system; likewise, the limitations of the system may also be unclear. Although it is tempting to use the ‘developer documentation’ as an entry-point, it will be much more helpful to begin by surveying the variety of Collective Access variants that have already been deployed by [other institutions](http://www.collectiveaccess.org/projects).A canonical example of Collective Access being used in production is that of the Chicago Film Archives. Embedded within the CFA website is a collections browser whose functionality is predominantly provided by [Pawtucket](https://github.com/collectiveaccess/pawtucket) – the Collective Access presentation module that is responsible for providing access to data that is stored in the cataloguing module [Providence](https://github.com/collectiveaccess/providence).In [browsing the CFA’s collections](http://www.chicagofilmarchives.org/collections/index.php/Browse/clearCriteria), some of the fundamental functions and limitations of Collective Access are revealed.#### Basic TablesFirstly, note the existence of several so-called object types. The most important of these include: entities (referred to here as People and Organisations); places; collections (i.e. objects that are related by way of a shared provenance, or a common intellectual theme); and objects (in this scenario, objects are specialised to suit the domain, and have been referred to as Videos, Films, Audio, and Manuscripts and Ephemera).Given that these types inform the structure of the database (they form the so-called [Basic Tables](http://docs.collectiveaccess.org/wiki/Basic_Tables)) that underlies Collective Access, as well as the associated models and controllers responsible for performing create, read, update, and delete operations, it is somewhat-relevant to consider that anything that cannot be captured by these types will require significant intervention.Fields, Relationships, and RepresentationsNow consider the records for a [specific video](http://www.chicagofilmarchives.org/collections/index.php/Detail/Object/Show/object_id/9219), and a [specific film](http://www.chicagofilmarchives.org/collections/index.php/Detail/Object/Show/object_id/14329); there are at least three observations to be made.Firstly, note that the set of fields used to describe the two kinds of objects are different (though they overlap). In particular, the Format field is irrelevant to a video (i.e. for the CFA, video is video – there are no video subtypes), though it is relevant for film (i.e. from the perspective of the CFA, 16mm film is consequentially distinct from 35mm film). This distinction hints at the extensibility of Collective Access: fields may be added or removed based on their relevance to an object type.Secondly, notice the hyperlinked fields at the top and bottom of the record (e.g. the Part Of links, and the links under Form, Subjects, Related Places, and Genre). It should be obvious that the relationships between records are essentially encoded as relationships between Basic Tables – that is, the video and the film are each a ca_object (i.e. in the parlance of the database layer) that are connected to records in the ca_lists (Form, Subjects, Genre), ca_collections (Part Of), and ca_places (Related Places) Basic Tables.Lastly, observe that both records embed a digitised video of the original object. Collective Access refers to associated media files as representations.#### SummaryThis section introduced the high-level functionality of Collective Access with reference to low-level concepts. In particular, the notion of Basic Tables is an extremely important reference point for determining how data is stored internally; moreover, the predefined Basic Tables strongly hint at the extent of the set of entity types that the system is designed to manage.Additionally, the object, entity, collection, and representation types are relevant to the Adam Art Gallery data – the CFA website portrays the canonical usage for these types.## <a name="installation"></a> Installation
